# SpecDiff-spoofing-detector
This repository contains an example code that calculates the SpecDiff descriptor proposed in "Specular- and Diffuse-reflection-based Face Spoofing Detection for Mobile Devices" to perform face spoofing detection. The SpecDiff descriptor utilizes specular and diffuse reflection of a facial image, enables fast-and-accurate spoofing detection without either a large training database or a high-performance computing system.

## Requirements
- MATLAB R2017b
